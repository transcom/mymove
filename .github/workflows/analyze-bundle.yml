# For Truss and how we use this repo, pull_request and
# pull_request_target have no differences
#
# https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/
#
#    Workflows triggered via pull_request_target have write permission
#    to the target repository. They also have access to target
#    repository secrets. The same is true for workflows triggered on
#    pull_request from a branch in the same repository, but not from
#    external forks.
#
# Truss always uses branches in the same repository
#
# Using pull_request means changes to the workflow file are used in
# the PR, which is incredibly helpful when testing out changes
