# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only matches a later pattern, only those later code
# owners will be requested for a review.
# Add language specific code owners if it becomes relevant

# README: Because the Prime UI Simulator work is outside the scope of design /
# frontend reviewing CSS changes, we set the following directories to have an
# "empty owner". This revokes the ownership of .css and .scss files in the
# directive above across the whole repository for any directories below for
# src/*/PrimeUI/
