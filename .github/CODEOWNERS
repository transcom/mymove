# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only matches a later pattern, only those later code
# owners will be requested for a review.
# Add language specific code owners if it becomes relevant

# ADRs are architectural decisions that, at least for now, should all be run by Nick
# with Jen Leech as a backup.
