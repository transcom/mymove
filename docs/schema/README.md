# Schema Documentation

This documentation was created using [SQLEditor](https://www.malcolmhardie.com/sqleditor/)

## Installing the tool

You can either download the installer directly from the [website](https://www.malcolmhardie.com/sqleditor/)
 or install SQLEditor via brew

```console
my_machine ~:$ brew cask install sqleditor
```

If you use SQLEditor frequently, you will need to purchase a license for the tool.

## Updating and changing the model

When you make changes to the model objects/add migrations to the pop code you should also make the corresponding changes
 to the diagram in the same PR.  Do this by importing from the DB and saving to the `dp3.sqs` file, overwriting
 the original. **DO NOT UPDATE THIS FILE BY HAND.**

Updating is accomplished in a few steps:

1. Reset the DB on your branch or master with `make db_dev_reset && make db_dev_migrate`
2. Open SQLEditor and go to (File -> Import From Database).  Entering the `dev_db` connection information. ![settings](SQLEditor_import.png)
3. After the data has been imported save the file as [dp3.sqs](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/docs/schema/dp3.sqs)
4. Commit the changes to your branch with `git add docs/schema/dp3.sqs`
5. Submit your changes for review from another team member
