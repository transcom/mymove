# Pairing Sessions

On MilMove, we encourage folks to pair program.
It can increase code quality,
knowledge sharing,
and team cohesion.
Teams may have different practices around when they pair program,
but when tackling a complex problem,
it's helpful to get multiple people's perspectives.

Recording pairing sessions can be helpful for documenting code decisions,
sharing knowledge with those not free to pair,
and keeping other teams aware of the work you're doing.

Pairing sessions can be recorded with Zoom
and added to the [MilMove Team Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1WMZ5FzzWMU-HzEr36QFfVRr8TRyuK8I-)

Please update this document with a brief description of the pairing session.
