# How to Upload Electronic Orders Using your CAC

## Requirements

The requirements are that you have a CAC and a CAC Reader. The recommended reader is the [Type C Smart Card Reader
Saicoo DOD Military USB-C Common Access Card Reader](https://www.amazon.com/Reader-Saicoo-Military-Compatible-Windows/dp/B071NT53M7/ref=sr_1_4).

To get going you will also need to install some software on your machine:

1. `brew install opensc` gives you tools like `pkcs11-tool` and `pkcs15-tool`

## MacOS 10.14 and earlier ONLY

**NOTE:** Skip this section if you are on MacOS `10.15.X` or later!!

Install the official Military CAC package from [CAC Key Packages](http://militarycac.org/MacVideos.htm#CACKey_packages) to get the driver `/usr/local/lib/pkcs11/cackey.dylib`

It's important that you disable default smart card access on your OSX machine. [Read the published instructions](http://militarycac.org/macuninstall.htm#Mojave_(10.14),_High_Sierra_(10.13.x),_and_Sierra_(10.12.x)_Built_in_Smart_Card_Ability). It boils down to removing your CAC from the reader, running this command and restarting your laptop:

```sh
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard DisabledTokens -array com.apple.CryptoTokenKit.pivtoken
```

## Prerequisites

To see if you are in a place to use your CAC to extract certs you need to run these commands:

```sh
cac-prereqs
prereqs
```

## How it works

Mutual TLS is used in the app to authentication traffic. Users are authorized by comparing a SHA 256 hash of the
public certificate in the presented certificate, which is stored on the user's CAC.
To get that information into the system we must create a secure migration that contains both the
SHA 256 fingerprint and the Subject on the CAC certificate.

## Generating a Secure Migration

To generate the secure migration run this step:

```sh
milmove gen certs-migration --name "${USER}_cac" --cac
```

You will see output like:

```text
2019/08/22 17:32:38 new migration file created at: "tmp/20190822173238_cgilmer_cac.up.sql"
2019/08/22 17:32:38 new migration file created at:  "migrations/app/secure/20190822173238_cgilmer_cac.up.sql"
2019/08/22 17:32:38 new migration appended to manifest at: "/dir/transcom/mymove/migrations/app/migrations_manifest.txt"
```

The generation script will provide three files and update the `migrations_manifest.txt` for you:

* A stub local secure migration in the `migrations/app/secure/` folder
* A migration to upload to AWS S3 in the `tmp/` folder

It is important only to upload the migration from the `tmp/` directory to the Staging and Experimental environments.
**DO NOT UPLOAD THIS MIGRATION TO PRODUCTION AS THERE SHOULD BE NO USE CASE FOR USING A PERSONAL CAC TO UPLOAD ORDERS IN PROD**.

## Preparing for Upload

Before uploading we'll remove some sensitive information and verify the migration script runs locally.

### Locally Testing Certificate

For testing locally (your file names will be different):

```sh
cp tmp/20190822181328_cgilmer_cac.up.sql migrations/app/secure/
update-migrations-manifest
```

Change the migration sql file for Devlocal only and update the `CN` field with your GitHub username. Your name and EPIDI should not be checked into git (however, your staging and experimental migration files should continue to have your name and EPIDI in the format `CN=LAST.FIRST.MIDDLE.EDIPI,...`).

Example:

```tex
CN=LAST.FIRST.MI.EDIPI,OU=DoD+OU=PKI+OU=CONTRACTOR,O=U.S. Government,C=US
# should be
CN=GITHUB_USERNAME,OU=DoD+OU=PKI+OU=CONTRACTOR,O=U.S. Government,C=US
```

Test this by running:

```bash
make db_dev_migrate
```

Make a PR with the secure migration sql file located in `migrations/app/secure` and addition to the `migrations_manifest.sql` file.

Validate your client certificate was updated (use your name):

```sh
psql-dev
> select * from client_certs where subject ILIKE '%GITHUB_USERNAME%';
```

Now to test this with transcom/nom you need to enable the Mutual TLS listener and then run the server. To do so modify your `.envrc.local` with this content:

```sh
export MUTUAL_TLS_ENABLED=1
make db_dev_e2e_populate
go run ./cmd/prime-api-client/main.go --insecure --cac | jq .
```

If the secure migration worked you should receive a response similar to

```json
[
  {
    "createdAt": "2020-01-22",
    "id": "5d4b25bb-eb04-4c03-9a81-ee0398cb7791",
    "isAvailableToPrime": true,
    "isCanceled": false,
    "moveOrderID": "6fca843a-a87e-4752-b454-0fac67aa4981",
    "mto_service_items": [],
    "payment_requests": [],
    "updatedAt": "2020-01-22"
  }
]
```



## Uploading CAC Secure Migration

Once the files have been generated by previous section next step is to upload them to the environments.

Upload to `experimental` and `staging` using the file in `tmp/`:

```bash
ENVIRONMENTS="experimental staging" ./scripts/upload-secure-migration tmp/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
```

For `prod` **do not** upload the same file. Instead we'll upload a stub file as a place holder since the migration process will be looking for such a file in `prod` environment.

```bash
echo "-- This is a stub file for user X" >> local_migrations/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
ENVIRONMENTS=prod ./scripts/upload-secure-migration local_migrations/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
```

Once completed confirm the upload with the `download-secure-migration` tool.

* Ensure the secure migration files for `experimental` and `staging` inserts a new record into the database with sensitive information.
* Ensure the secure migration file for `prod` is just a stub and does not insert a record

```bash
download-secure-migration 20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
Downloading from: experimental
...executing: aws s3 cp s3://transcom-ppp-app-experimental-us-west-2/secure-migrations/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql ./tmp/secure_migrations/experimental/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
Downloading from: staging
...executing: aws s3 cp s3://transcom-ppp-app-staging-us-west-2/secure-migrations/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql ./tmp/secure_migrations/staging/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
Downloading from: prod
...executing: aws s3 cp s3://transcom-ppp-app-prod-us-west-2/secure-migrations/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql ./tmp/secure_migrations/prod/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql

Files have been downloaded to these locations:

./tmp/secure_migrations/prod/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
./tmp/secure_migrations/experimental/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql
./tmp/secure_migrations/staging/20200211150405_mr337_cac.up.sql

Please remember to 'rm -rf ./tmp/secure_migrations' when you are finished working
```



## Manually Generating a Secure Migration

**NOTE:**  Only follow these steps if you need to manually extract values from a CAC that you don't have physical access to.

To get the Fingerprint and Subject the user can run these commands:

```sh
cac-extract-fingerprint
cac-extract-subject
```

Now you need to generate the secure migration with these scripts:

```sh
FINGERPRINT=`cac-extract-fingerprint`
SUBJECT=`cac-extract-subject`
milmove gen certs-migration --name "${USER}_cac" -f "${FINGERPRINT}" -s "${SUBJECT}"
```

The output is the same as in the above steps.
