## Migrations

If you need to change the database schema, you'll need to write a migration.

### Creating a migration

Use soda (a part of [pop](https://github.com/gobuffalo/pop/)) to generate migrations. In order to make using soda easy, a wrapper is in `./bin/soda` that sets the go environment and working directory correctly.

If you are generating a new model, use: `./bin/gen_model model-name column-name:type column-name:type ...`. The fields `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at` are all created automatically.

If you are modifying an existing model, use `./bin/soda generate migration migration-name` and add the [Fizz commands](https://github.com/gobuffalo/fizz) yourself to the created `{migration_name}.up.fizz` file. Delete the `down.fizz` file, as we aren't using those (see note below.)

**Note**: We don't use down-migrations to revert changes to the schema; any problems are to be fixed by a follow-up migration.

## Zero-Downtime Migrations

As a good practice, all of our migrations should create a database state that works both with the current version of the application code _and_ the new version of the application code. This allows us to run migrations before the new app code is live without creating downtime for our users. More in-depth list of migrations that might cause issues are outlined in our [google drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ht57qz1ut--fqTQdLKbCqbZO_f_S0UoVSIyO6Bg-wJw).

Eg: If we need to rename a column, doing a traditional rename would cause the app to fail if the database changes went live before the new application code (pointing to the new column name) went live. Instead, this should be done in a two-stage process.

1. Write a migration adding a new column with the preferred name and copy the data from the old column into it. The old column will effectively be deprecated at this point.
2. After the migration and new app code have been deployed to production, write a second migration to remove the old/deprecated column.

Similarly, if a column needs to be dropped, we should deprecate the column in one pull request and then actually remove it in a follow-up pull request. Deprecation can be done by renaming the column to `deprecated_column_name`. This process has an added side affect of helping us keep our migrations reversible, since columns can always be re-added, but getting old data back into those columns is a more difficult process.

## Secure Migrations

**NOTICE**: Before adding SSNs or other PII, please consult with Infra.

We are piggy-backing on the migration system for importing static datasets. This approach causes problems if the data isn't public, as all of the migrations are in this open source repository. To address this, we have what are called "secure migrations."

To create a secure migration:

* Generate new migration files: `bin/generate-secure-migration <migration_name>`
  * This creates two migration files: a local test file with no secret data, and a production file to be uploaded to S3 that will have sensitive data.
* Edit the production migration first, and put whatever sensitive data in it that you need to.
* Copy the production migration into the local test migration.
* Scrub the test migration of sensitive data, but use it to test the gist of the production migration operation.
* Test the local migration by running `make db_dev_migrate`. You should see it run your local migration.
* Upload the migration to S3 with: `bin/upload-secure-migration <production_migration_file>`
* Open a pull request!
* When the pull request lands, the production migrations will be run on Staging and Prod.

Gory Details:

When this migration is run, `soda` will shell out to our script, `apply-secure-migration.sh`. This script will:

* Look at `$SECURE_MIGRATION_SOURCE` to determine if the migrations should be found locally (`local`, for dev & testing,) or on S3 (`s3`).
* If the file is to be found on S3, it is downloaded from `${AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME}/secure-migrations/${FILENAME}`.
* If it is to be found locally, the script looks for it in `$SECURE_MIGRATION_DIR`.
* Regardless of where the migration comes from, it is then applied to the database by essentially doing: `psql < ${FILENAME}`.

There is an example of a secure migration [in the repo](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/migrations/20180424010930_test_secure_migrations.up.fizz).
