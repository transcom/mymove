## Pop SQL logging on by default in development

Pop is an ORM which helps ease communication with the database by providing database API abstraction code. However, this can obscure the actual SQL that is being executed without a in-depth knowledge of the ORM. By enabling SQL logging in development a developer can see the queries being executed by Pop as they happen to hopefully help developers to catch issues in the setup of database calls with Pop.

If you want to turn this off _temporarily_, just prefix your command with `DB_DEBUG=0` for example:

> DB_DEBUG=0 make server_run

If you need to turn this off _permanently_ on your local instance add the following to the `.envrc.local` file

> export DB_DEBUG=0

### Some problems to look out for with SQL logging on

#### Excessive Queries (e.g. n+1 Problem)

When looking up objects that have a one-to-many relationship, ORMs such as Pop can fire off n+1 queries to the database to do the look up for n number of child objects + 1 for the original parent object. Depending on the size of n this will cause performance issues loading such lists of objects that have many children. To help prevent this in Pop, developers should avoid using unbounded `Eager()` calls and try and only fetch children when that data is needed. For more through description of the issue please read the following references.
