/*
	CreatePaymentRequest creates payment request

	Creates a new instance of a paymentRequest and is assigned the status `PENDING`.

A move task order can have multiple payment requests, and
a final payment request can be marked using boolean `isFinal`.

If a `PENDING` payment request is recalculated,
a new payment request is created and the original request is
marked with the status `DEPRECATED`.

**NOTE**: In order to create a payment request for most service items, the shipment *must*
be updated with the `PrimeActualWeight` value via [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment).

**FSC - Fuel Surcharge** service items require `ActualPickupDate` to be updated on the shipment.

A service item can be on several payment requests in the case of partial payment requests and payments.

In the request, if no params are necessary, then just the `serviceItem` `id` is required. For example:
```json

	{
	  "isFinal": false,
	  "moveTaskOrderID": "uuid",
	  "serviceItems": [
	    {
	      "id": "uuid",
	    },
	    {
	      "id": "uuid",
	      "params": [
	        {
	          "key": "Service Item Parameter Name",
	          "value": "Service Item Parameter Value"
	        }
	      ]
	    }
	  ],
	  "pointOfContact": "string"
	}

```

SIT Service Items & Accepted Payment Request Parameters:
---
If `WeightBilled` is not provided then the full shipment weight (`PrimeActualWeight`) will be considered in the calculation.

**NOTE**: Diversions have a unique calcuation for payment requests without a `WeightBilled` parameter.

If you created a payment request for a diversion and `WeightBilled` is not provided, then the following will be used in the calculation:
- The lowest shipment weight (`PrimeActualWeight`) found in the diverted shipment chain.
- The lowest reweigh weight found in the diverted shipment chain.

The diverted shipment chain is created by referencing the `diversion` boolean, `divertedFromShipmentId` UUID, and matching destination to pickup addresses.
If the chain cannot be established it will fall back to the `PrimeActualWeight` of the current shipment. This is utilized because diverted shipments are all one single shipment, but going to different locations.
The lowest weight found is the true shipment weight, and thus we search the chain of shipments for the lowest weight found.

/*
	CreateUpload creates upload

	### Functionality

This endpoint **uploads** a Proof of Service document for a PaymentRequest.

The PaymentRequest should already exist.

Optional key of **isWeightTicket** indicates if the document is a weight ticket or not.
This will be used for partial and full deliveries and makes it easier for the Task Invoicing Officers to locate and review service item documents.
If left empty, it will assume it is NOT a weight ticket.

The formdata in the body of the POST request that is sent should look like this if it IS a weight ticket being attached to an existing payment request:

	```json
	{
	  "file": "filePath",
	  "isWeightTicket": true
	}
	```
	If the proof of service doc is NOT a weight ticket, it will look like this - or you can leave it empty:
	```json
	{
	  "file": "filePath",
	  "isWeightTicket": false
	}
	```
	```json
	{
	  "file": "filePath",
	}
	```

PaymentRequests are created with the [createPaymentRequest](#operation/createPaymentRequest) endpoint.
