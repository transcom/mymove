	UpdateMTOShipment updates m t o shipment

	_[Deprecated: sunset on August 5th, 2024]_ This endpoint is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

Please use the new endpoint at `/prime/v2/updateMTOShipment` instead.

**DEPRECATION ON AUGUST 5TH, 2024**
Following deprecation, there is an edge case scenario where a PPM shipment with no addresses could be updated and it would also update the final destination SIT address
for SIT service items. This edge case has been removed as you should not be able to update items using this endpoint. Third-party APIs have confirmed they will require
deprecation for this change.

Updates an existing shipment for a move.

Note that there are some restrictions on nested objects:

* Service items: You cannot add or update service items using this endpoint. Please use [createMTOServiceItem](#operation/createMTOServiceItem) and [updateMTOServiceItem](#operation/updateMTOServiceItem) instead.
* Agents: You cannot add or update agents using this endpoint. Please use [createMTOAgent](#operation/createMTOAgent) and [updateMTOAgent](#operation/updateMTOAgent) instead.
* Addresses: You can add new addresses using this endpoint (and must use this endpoint to do so), but you cannot update existing ones. Please use [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#operation/updateMTOShipmentAddress) instead.

These restrictions are due to our [optimistic locking/concurrency control](https://transcom.github.io/mymove-docs/docs/dev/contributing/backend/use-optimistic-locking) mechanism.

Note that some fields cannot be manually changed but will still be updated automatically, such as `primeEstimatedWeightRecordedDate` and `requiredDeliveryDate`.

	UpdateMTOShipmentAddress updates m t o shipment address

	### Functionality

This endpoint is used to **update** the pickup, secondary, and destination addresses on an MTO Shipment. mto-shipments/{mtoShipmentID}/shipment-address-updates is for updating a delivery address. The address details completely replace the original, except for the UUID.
Therefore a complete address should be sent in the request.
When a destination address on a shipment is updated, the destination SIT service items address ID will also be updated so that shipment and service item final destinations match.

This endpoint **cannot create** an address.
To create an address on an MTO shipment, the caller must use [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment) as the parent shipment has to be updated with the appropriate link to the address.

### Errors
The address must be associated with the mtoShipment passed in the url.
In other words, it should be listed as pickupAddress, destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress or secondaryDeliveryAddress on the mtoShipment provided.
If it is not, caller will receive a **Conflict** Error.

The mtoShipment should be associated with an MTO that is available to prime.
If the caller requests an update to an address, and the shipment is not on an available MTO, the caller will receive a **NotFound** Error.

This endpoint is used so the Prime can request an **update** for the destination address on an MTO Shipment,

This endpoint and operation only supports the following shipment types:
- HHG
- NTSR

For HHG shipments, if automatically approved or TOO approves, this will update the final destination address values for destination SIT service items to be the same as the changed destination address that was approved.

Address updates will be automatically approved unless they change:
  - The service area
  - Mileage bracket for direct delivery
  - the address and the distance between the old and new address is > 50
  - Domestic Short Haul to Domestic Line Haul or vice versa
  - Shipments that start and end in one ZIP3 use Short Haul pricing
  - Shipments that start and end in different ZIP3s use Line Haul pricing

For those, changes will require TOO approval.
