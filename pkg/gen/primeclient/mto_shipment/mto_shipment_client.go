	UpdateMTOShipmentAddress updates m t o shipment address

	### Functionality

This endpoint is used to **update** the pickup, secondary, and delivery addresses on an MTO Shipment. mto-shipments/{mtoShipmentID}/shipment-address-updates is for updating a delivery address. The address details completely replace the original, except for the UUID.
Therefore a complete address should be sent in the request.
When a delivery address on a shipment is updated, the destination SIT service items address ID will also be updated so that shipment and service item final destinations match.

This endpoint **cannot create** an address.
To create an address on an MTO shipment, the caller must use [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment) as the parent shipment has to be updated with the appropriate link to the address.

### Errors
The address must be associated with the mtoShipment passed in the url.
In other words, it should be listed as pickupAddress, destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress or secondaryDeliveryAddress on the mtoShipment provided.
If it is not, caller will receive a **Conflict** Error.

The mtoShipment should be associated with an MTO that is available to prime.
If the caller requests an update to an address, and the shipment is not on an available MTO, the caller will receive a **NotFound** Error.

	### Functionality

This endpoint is used so the Prime can request an **update** for the delivery address on an MTO Shipment,
after the delivery address has already been approved.

This endpoint and operation only supports the following shipment types:
- HHG
- NTSR

For HHG shipments, if automatically approved or TOO approves, this will update the final delivery address values for destination SIT service items to be the same as the changed delivery address that was approved.

Address updates will be automatically approved unless they change:
  - The service area
  - Mileage bracket for direct delivery
  - the address and the distance between the old and new address is > 50
  - Domestic Short Haul to Domestic Line Haul or vice versa
  - Shipments that start and end in one ZIP3 use Short Haul pricing
  - Shipments that start and end in different ZIP3s use Line Haul pricing

For those, changes will require TOO approval.
