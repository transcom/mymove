// PPMShipmentStatus Status of the PPM Shipment:
//   - **DRAFT**: The customer has created the PPM shipment but has not yet submitted their move for counseling.
//   - **SUBMITTED**: The shipment belongs to a move that has been submitted by the customer or has been created by a Service Counselor or Prime Contractor for a submitted move.
//   - **WAITING_ON_CUSTOMER**: The PPM shipment has been approved and the customer may now provide their actual move closeout information and documentation required to get paid.
//   - **NEEDS_ADVANCE_APPROVAL**: The shipment was counseled by the Prime Contractor and approved but an advance was requested so will need further financial approval from the government.
//   - **NEEDS_PAYMENT_APPROVAL**: The customer has provided their closeout weight tickets, receipts, and expenses and certified it for the Service Counselor to approve, exclude or reject.
//   - **PAYMENT_APPROVED**: The Service Counselor has reviewed all of the customer's PPM closeout documentation and authorizes the customer can download and submit their finalized SSW packet.
