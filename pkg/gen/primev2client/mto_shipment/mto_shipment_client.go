/*
	CreateMTOShipment creates m t o shipment

	Creates a new shipment within the specified move. This endpoint should be used whenever the movers identify a

need for an additional shipment. The new shipment will be submitted to the TOO for review, and the TOO must
approve it before the contractor can proceed with billing.

**NOTE**: If you create a new diverted shipment with the `diversion` and `divertedFromShipmentId` parameter, it will automatically
inherit the reweigh and actual weight of its `divertedFromShipmentId` parent. It establishes the chain by looking up by this
UUID, and checking that the destination address of the `divertedFromShipmentId` parent matches the pickup address of this new shipment.
If it does not match this automatic application of weights will not execute as it does not successfully create a diversion chain.

**WIP**: The Prime should be notified by a push notification whenever the TOO approves a shipment connected to
one of their moves. Otherwise, the Prime can fetch the related move using the
[getMoveTaskOrder](#operation/getMoveTaskOrder) endpoint and see if this shipment has the status `"APPROVED"`.
