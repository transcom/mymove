createMTOShipment

Creates a new shipment within the specified move. This endpoint should be used whenever the movers identify a
need for an additional shipment. The new shipment will be submitted to the TOO for review, and the TOO must
approve it before the contractor can proceed with billing.

**NOTE**: When creating a child shipment diversion, you can no longer specify the `primeActualWeight`.
If you create a new diverted shipment with the `diversion` and `divertedFromShipmentId` parameter, it will automatically
inherit the primeActualWeight of its `divertedFromShipmentId` parent. Payment requests created on a diverted shipment "chain" will utilize
the lowest weight possible in the chain to prevent overcharging as they are still separate shipments.

**NOTE**: New version in v3. Version will accept PPM addresses[pickupAddress, destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress
secondaryDestinationAddress]. PPM postalCodes will be phased out[pickupPostalCode, secondaryPickupPostalCode,
destinationPostalCode and secondaryDestinationPostalCode].

**WIP**: The Prime should be notified by a push notification whenever the TOO approves a shipment connected to
one of their moves. Otherwise, the Prime can fetch the related move using the
[getMoveTaskOrder](#operation/getMoveTaskOrder) endpoint and see if this shipment has the status `"APPROVED"`.
