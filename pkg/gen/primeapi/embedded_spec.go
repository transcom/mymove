One move may include multiple shipments.\nAn **mtoShipment**, in particular, is a shipment that belongs to a [moveTaskOrder](#tag/moveTaskOrder).\n\nThe weights for all of the shipments in a move are combined and compared to the customer's weight allowance.\nIf the sum of the shipments is greater, the customer is liable for paying excess weight cost. Both the customer and\nthe contractor should keep this potential cost in mind when planning a move and the shipments within it.\n",
