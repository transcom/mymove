/* UpdateMTOShipmentAddress swagger:route PUT /mto-shipments/{mtoShipmentID}/addresses/{addressID} mtoShipment updateMTOShipmentAddress

updateMTOShipmentAddress

### Functionality
This endpoint is used to **update** the addresses on an MTO Shipment. The address details completely replace the original, except for the UUID.
Therefore a complete address should be sent in the request.

This endpoint **cannot create** an address.
To create an address on an MTO shipment, the caller must use [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment) as the parent shipment has to be updated with the appropriate link to the address.

### Errors
The address must be associated with the mtoShipment passed in the url.
In other words, it should be listed as pickupAddress, destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress or secondaryDeliveryAddress on the mtoShipment provided.
If it is not, caller will receive a **Conflict** Error.

The mtoShipment should be associated with an MTO that is available to prime.
If the caller requests an update to an address, and the shipment is not on an available MTO, the caller will receive a **NotFound** Error.
