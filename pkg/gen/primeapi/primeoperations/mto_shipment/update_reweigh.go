updateReweigh

### Functionality
This endpoint can be used to update a reweigh with a new weight or to provide the reason why a reweigh did not occur.
Only one of weight or verificationReason should be sent in the request body.

A reweigh is the second recorded weight for a shipment, as validated by certified weight tickets. Applies to one shipment.
A reweigh can be triggered automatically, or requested by the customer or transportation office. Not all shipments are reweighed,
so not all shipments will have a reweigh weight.
