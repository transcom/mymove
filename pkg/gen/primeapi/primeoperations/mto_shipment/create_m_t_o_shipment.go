/* CreateMTOShipment swagger:route POST /mto-shipments mtoShipment createMTOShipment

createMTOShipment

Creates a new shipment within the specified move. This endpoint should be used whenever the movers identify a
need for an additional shipment. The new shipment will be submitted to the TOO for review, and the TOO must
approve it before the contractor can proceed with billing.

**WIP**: The Prime should be notified by a push notification whenever the TOO approves a shipment connected to
one of their moves. Otherwise, the Prime can fetch the related move using the
[getMoveTaskOrder](#operation/getMoveTaskOrder) endpoint and see if this shipment has the status `"APPROVED"`.
