/*
Test to see that the EnableIAM method is working.
It should be sufficient to check that the EnableIAM method is working by:
Setting an initial password, running EnableIAM, and then verifying that the
currentPassword is no longer the initial password, but is instead the password
that EnableIAM is cycling through.

While this wont completely eliminate the flakiness (since the test still needs
to wait for the password to change), it should significantly reduce the
flakiness by only having 1 sleep and 1 password to swtich to.

The test was written in this manner since testing to see that multiple
passwords are being cycled through will inherently make the test timing
dependent and thus, flaky.
i.e. If a new password gets cycled every 1 minute, the test would need to
sleep for a minute and then check to see that the current password is correct
one in the sequence. If anything falls out of sync, then the tests will fail
since what is expected will be dsycned from what is retrieved.
