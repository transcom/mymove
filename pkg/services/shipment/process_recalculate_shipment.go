/*
	Recalculate a shipment's line items is temporary functionality that will be used when it has been
    determined there is some shipment that requires recalculation. A shipment does not contain line items
    until it has reached the DELIVERED state.

    Some of the reasons a recalculation can happen are:
      - missing required pre-approved line items
      - line items that have been priced incorrectly (this is detected by saying that a line item could have been
        priced erroneously if priced in this specified date range)

    The database table shipment_recalculate contains the date range for shipments that need to be assessed.

    The database table shipment_recalculate_log contains a record entry for each shipment that was recalculated.

    Currently to recalculate a shipment we are looking for the following:
      - Shipment is in DELIVERED or COMPLETED state
      - If the Shipment was created within the specified recalculation date range
      - Shipment has a line item that has been updated before the date shipment_recalculate.updated_before
      - If there is an approved accessorial, this line item must be preserved to maintain the approved status
      - If a Shipment does not have all of the Base Shipment Line Items it will be re-calculated
      - Shipment does not have any line item that has an InvoiceID

    The API that will call this method is GET /shipments/{shipmentId}/accessorials
