This is a confirmation that you’ve submitted the details for your move {{if .OriginDutyLocation}}from {{.OriginDutyLocation}} {{ end }}to {{.DestinationDutyLocation}}.

We’ve assigned you a move code: {{.Locator}}. You can use this code when talking to any representative about your move.

To change any other information about your move, or to add or cancel shipments, you should tell your movers (if you’re using them) or your move counselor.

Your weight allowance: {{.WeightAllowance}} pounds
That’s how much the government will pay to ship for you on this move. You won’t owe anything if all your shipments combined weigh less than that.

If you move more than {{.WeightAllowance}} pounds, you will owe the government the difference between that and the total amount you move.

Your movers will estimate the total weight of your belongings, and you will be notified if it looks like you might exceed your weight allowance. But you’re ultimately responsible for the weight you move.

Next steps:
* Talk to a move counselor
* Talk to your movers

You can ask questions of your move counselor or your point of contact with the movers. They will both get in touch with you soon.

Your counselor will:
* Verify the information you entered
* Give you moving-related advice
* Give you tips to avoid going over your weight allowance
* Identify things like pro-gear that won’t count against your weight allowance

When the movers contact you, they’ll schedule a pre-move survey to estimate the total weight of your belongings.

They’ll also finalize dates to pack and pick up your things, on or near the date you requested in MilMove.

If any information about your move changes at any point during the move, let your movers know.

Good luck on your move to {{.DestinationDutyLocation}}!
