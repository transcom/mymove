Upon review, the office has determined that MilMove can’t handle your move {{if .OriginDutyLocation}}from {{.OriginDutyLocation}} {{end}}to {{.DestinationDutyLocation}}, and canceled it in the system. You’re still moving, but we’ll need to manage your move with a different system.

{{if .OriginDutyLocation}}
Please call the PPPO at {{.OriginDutyLocation}} at {{.OriginDutyLocationPhoneLine}} and they’ll help you figure out what to do next.
{{ else }}
To talk with someone on what to do next, consult Military OneSource's directory of PCS-related contacts to find your best contact and reference move code {{.Locator}}.
