{{- if not .NavalBranch}}
<p>For {{.ServiceBranch}} personnel (FURTHER ACTION REQUIRED):

<p>Note: The Transportation Office does not determine claimable expenses. Claimable expenses will be determined by finance.</p>
{{else}}
<p>For Marine Corps, Navy, and Coast Guard personnel:</p>
<p>You can now log into MilMove <https://my.move.mil/> and view your payment packet; however, you do not need to forward your packet to finance as your closeout location is associated with your finance office and they will handle this step for you.</p>
<p>Note: Not all claimed expenses may have been accepted during PPM closeout if they did not meet the definition of a valid expense.</p>
