<p>We hope your move to {{.DestinationDutyStation}} went well.</p>

<p>It’s been a couple of weeks, so we want to make sure you get paid for that move. You expected to move about 3,500 lbs, which gives you an estimated incentive of $3,480–4,500.</p>

<p>To get your incentive, you need to request payment.</p>

<p>Log in to MilMove and request payment</p>

<p>We want to pay you for your PPM, but we can’t do that until you document expenses and request payment.</p>

<p>To do that</p>

<p>Log in to MilMove</p>
<p>Click Request Payment</p>
<p>Follow the instructions.</p>
<p>What documents do you need?</p>

<p>To request payment, you should have copies of:</p>
<p>Weight tickets from certified scales, documenting empty and full weights for all vehicles and trailers you used for your move</p>
<p>Receipts for reimbursable expenses (see our moving tips PDF for more info)</p>

<p>MilMove will ask you to upload copies of your documents as you complete your payment request.</p>

<p>What if you’re missing documents?</p>

<p>If you’re missing receipts, you can still request payment. You might not get reimbursement or a tax credit for those expenses.</p>

<p>If you’re missing certified weight tickets, your PPPO will have to help. Call the [JB McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst] PPPO at [(555) 555-1234] to have them walk you through it.</p>

<p>Log in to MilMove to complete your request and get paid.</p>
