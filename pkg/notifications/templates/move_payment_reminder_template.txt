We hope your move to {{.DestinationDutyLocation}} went well.

It’s been a couple of weeks, so we want to make sure you get paid for that move. {{.IncentiveTxt}}

To get your incentive, you need to request payment.

Log in to MilMove and request payment

We want to pay you for your PPM, but we can’t do that until you document expenses and request payment.

To do that

  * Log in to MilMove
  * Click Request Payment
  * Follow the instructions.

What documents do you need?

To request payment, you should have copies of:
  * Weight tickets from certified scales, documenting empty and full weights for all vehicles and trailers you used for your move
  * Receipts for reimbursable expenses (see our moving tips PDF for more info)

MilMove will ask you to upload copies of your documents as you complete your payment request.

What if you’re missing documents?

If you’re missing receipts, you can still request payment. You might not get reimbursement or a tax credit for those expenses.

If you’re missing certified weight tickets, your PPPO will have to help. {{if .TOName}}Call {{.TOName}}{{if .TOPhone}} at {{.TOPhone}}{{end}} to have them walk you through it. Reference your move locator code: {{.Locator}}.{{end}}

Log in to MilMove to complete your request and get paid.

Request payment within 45 days of your move date or you might not be able to get paid.

{{if .TOName}}If you have any questions or concerns, you can talk to a human! Call your local PPPO at {{.TOName}}{{if .TOPhone}} at {{ .TOPhone}}{{end}}. Reference your move locator code: {{.Locator}}.{{end}}
