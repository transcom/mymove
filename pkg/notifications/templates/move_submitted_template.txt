This is a confirmation that you’ve submitted the details for your move from {{.OriginDutyStation}} to {{.DestinationDutyStation}}.

We’ve assigned you a move code: {{.Locator}}. You can use this code when talking to any representative about your move.

To change any other information about your move, or to add or cancel shipments, you should tell your movers (if you’re using them) or your move counselor.

Your weight allowance: {{.WeightAllowance}} pounds
That’s how much the government will pay to ship for you on this move. You won’t owe anything if all your shipments combined weigh less than that.

If you move more than {{.WeightAllowance}} pounds, you will owe the government the difference between that and the total amount you move.

Your movers will estimate the total weight of your belongings, and you will be notified if it looks like you might exceed your weight allowance. But you’re ultimately responsible for the weight you move.

For PPM (DITY, or do-it-yourself) shipments
If you chose to do a full or partial PPM (DITY) move, <a href="{{.PpmLink}}"> review the Personally Procured Move (PPM) info sheet</a> for detailed instructions.
* Start your PPM shipment whenever you are ready
* You can wait until after you talk to your move counselor
* Getting your PPM shipment moved to your new home is entirely in your hands
* You can move everything yourself, hire help, or even hire your own movers
* You are responsible for any damage to your belongings
* Get certified weight tickets that show the empty and full weight for each vehicle used in each PPM shipment
* If you’re missing weight tickets, you may not get paid for your PPM
* Save receipts for PPM expenses to request reimbursement or to reduce taxes on your incentive payment

If you have any questions about the PPM part of your move, call the {{.OriginDutyStation}} PPPO at {{.OriginDutyStationPhoneLine}} and reference move code {{.Locator}}.

Once you’ve completed your PPM shipment, you can request payment by <a href="{{.Link}}">logging in to MilMove</a>.

For HHG and other government-funded shipments

Next steps:
* Talk to a move counselor
* Talk to your movers

You can ask questions of your move counselor or your point of contact with the movers. They will both get in touch with you soon.

Your counselor will:
* Verify the information you entered
* Give you moving-related advice
* Give you tips to avoid going over your weight allowance
* Identify things like pro-gear that won’t count against your weight allowance

When the movers contact you, they’ll schedule a pre-move survey to estimate the total weight of your belongings.

They’ll also finalize dates to pack and pick up your things, on or near the date you requested in MilMove.

If any information about your move changes at any point during the move, let your movers know.

Good luck on your move to {{.DestinationDutyStation}}!
