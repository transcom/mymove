  Upon review, the office has determined that MilMove can’t handle your move from {{.OriginDutyStation}} to
  {{.DestinationDutyStation}}, and canceled it in the system. You’re still moving, but we’ll need to manage your move
  with a different system.

<p>
  Please call the PPPO at {{.OriginDutyStation}} at {{.OriginDutyStationPhoneLine}} and they’ll help you figure out what
  to do next.
