Upon review, the office has determined that MilMove can’t handle your move {{if .OriginDutyStation}}from {{.OriginDutyStation}} {{end}}to {{.DestinationDutyStation}}, and canceled it in the system. You’re still moving, but we’ll need to manage your move with a different system.

{{if .OriginDutyStation}}Please call the PPPO at {{.OriginDutyStation}} at {{.OriginDutyStationPhoneLine}} and they’ll help you figure out what to do next.{{end}}
