    The Prime API is a RESTful API that enables the Prime contractor to request

    information about upcoming moves, update the details and status of those
    moves,

    and make payment requests. It uses Mutual TLS for authentication procedures.


    All endpoints are located at `/prime/v1/`.

schemes:
  - http
tags:
  - name: moveTaskOrder
    description: >
      The **moveTaskOrder** represents a military move that has been sent to a
      contractor. It contains all the information about shipments, including
      service items, estimated weights, actual weights, requested and scheduled
      move dates, etc.
  - name: mtoShipment
    description: >
      A shipment is some (or all) of a customer's belongings picked up in one
      location and delivered to another location.

      All of the items in a shipment are weighed and transported as a discrete
      unit. One move may include multiple shipments.

      An **mtoShipment**, in particular, is a shipment that belongs to a
      [moveTaskOrder](#tag/moveTaskOrder).


      The weights for all of the shipments in a move are combined and compared
      to the customer's weight allowance.

      If the sum of the shipments is greater, the customer is liable for paying
      excess weight cost. Both the customer and

      the contractor should keep this potential cost in mind when planning a
      move and the shipments within it.
  - name: mtoServiceItem
    description: >
      A service item is a service that the contractor can bill for. For example,
      if the movers pack and/or unpack a

      customer's belongings, those are billable services (packing and
      unpacking). All **mtoServiceItems** must be

      approved by the TOO before payment can be requested.


      There are three types of service items: accessorial, MTO-level, and
      standard.


      **WIP:** Add an external link to an article that explains the different
      types of service items in more detail.
  - name: paymentRequest
    description: >
      The contractor submits a **paymentRequest** to the TIO for approval in
      order to be reimbursed for 1 or more

      **mtoServiceItems** on a **moveTaskOrder**. A service item can be on
      multiple payment requests if necessary.


      Proof of service documentation may be uploaded for each **mtoServiceItem**
      in a **paymentRequest** after the payment

      request is created via the endpoint
      [createUpload](#operation/createUpload).


      All weight entered should be in *pounds* and no other unit of measurement.
  - name: sitAddressUpdate
    description: >
      **THIS ENDPOINT WILL BE DEPRECATED ON AUGUST 5TH, 2024 - REFER TO
      DESCRIPTION FOR DETAILS**


      A **sitAddressUpdate** is submitted when the prime or office user wishes
      to update the final address for an

      approved service item. sitAddressUpdates with a distance less than or
      equal to 50 miles will be automatically

      approved while a distance greater than 50 miles will typically require
      office user approval.

        requests, is later than the provided date and time.

        move status and marks child elements of the move to indicate the update.

        No body object is expected for this request.

        can start uploading their proof of service docs.


        **For other move types**: This action is required for auditing reasons
        so that we have a record of when the Prime counseled the customer.

        **DEPRECATION ON AUGUST 5TH, 2024**

        Following deprecation, there is an edge case scenario where a PPM
        shipment with no addresses could be updated and it would also update the
        final destination SIT address

        for SIT service items. This edge case has been removed as you should not
        be able to update items using this endpoint. Third-party APIs have
        confirmed they will require

        deprecation for this change.


        Updates an existing shipment for a move.


        Note that there are some restrictions on nested objects:


        * Service items: You cannot add or update service items using this
        endpoint. Please use
        [createMTOServiceItem](#operation/createMTOServiceItem) and
        [updateMTOServiceItem](#operation/updateMTOServiceItem) instead.

        * Agents: You cannot add or update agents using this endpoint. Please
        use [createMTOAgent](#operation/createMTOAgent) and
        [updateMTOAgent](#operation/updateMTOAgent) instead.

        * Addresses: You can add new addresses using this endpoint (and must use
        this endpoint to do so), but you cannot update existing ones. Please use
        [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#operation/updateMTOShipmentAddress) instead.


        These restrictions are due to our [optimistic locking/concurrency
        control](https://transcom.github.io/mymove-docs/docs/dev/contributing/backend/use-optimistic-locking)
        mechanism.


        Note that some fields cannot be manually changed but will still be

      description: >
        ### Functionality

        This endpoint is used to **update** the pickup, secondary, and
        destination addresses on an MTO Shipment.
        mto-shipments/{mtoShipmentID}/shipment-address-updates is for updating a
        delivery address. The address details completely replace the original,
        except for the UUID.

        Therefore a complete address should be sent in the request.

        When a destination address on a shipment is updated, the destination SIT
        service items address ID will also be updated so that shipment and
        service item final destinations match.


        This endpoint **cannot create** an address.

        To create an address on an MTO shipment, the caller must use
        [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment) as the parent shipment
        has to be updated with the appropriate link to the address.


        ### Errors

        The address must be associated with the mtoShipment passed in the url.

        In other words, it should be listed as pickupAddress,
        destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress or secondaryDeliveryAddress
        on the mtoShipment provided.

        If it is not, caller will receive a **Conflict** Error.


        The mtoShipment should be associated with an MTO that is available to
        prime.

        If the caller requests an update to an address, and the shipment is not
        on an available MTO, the caller will receive a **NotFound** Error.

        ### Functionality

        This endpoint is used so the Prime can request an **update** for the
        destination address on an MTO Shipment,

        after the destination address has already been approved.

        If automatically approved or TOO approves, this will update the final
        destination address values for destination SIT service items to be the
        same as the changed destination address that was approved.

        Address updates will be automatically approved unless they change:
          - The service area
          - Mileage bracket for direct delivery
          - the address and the distance between the old and new address is > 50
          - Domestic Short Haul to Domestic Line Haul or vice versa
              - Shipments that start and end in one ZIP3 use Short Haul pricing
              - Shipments that start and end in different ZIP3s use Line Haul pricing

        For those, changes will require TOO approval.

        be created using this

        model type with the following codes:


        **DOFSIT**


        **1st day origin SIT service item**. When a DOFSIT is requested, the API
        will auto-create the following group of service items:
          * DOFSIT - Domestic origin 1st day SIT
          * DOASIT - Domestic origin Additional day SIT
          * DOPSIT - Domestic origin SIT pickup
          * DOSFSC - Domestic origin SIT fuel surcharge

        **DOASIT**


        **Addt'l days origin SIT service item**. This represents an additional
        day of storage for the same item.

        Additional DOASIT service items can be created and added to an existing
        shipment that **includes a DOFSIT service item**.

        This endpoint supports different body definitions. In the modelType
        field below, select the modelType corresponding
         to the service item you wish to update and the documentation will update with the new definition.

        * Addresses: To update a destination service item's SIT destination
        final address, update the shipment destination address.

        For approved shipments, please use
        [updateShipmentDestinationAddress](#mtoShipment/updateShipmentDestinationAddress).

        For shipments not yet approved, please use
        [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#mtoShipment/updateMTOShipmentAddress).


        * SIT Service Items: Take note that when updating
        `sitCustomerContacted`, `sitDepartureDate`, or `sitRequestedDelivery`,
        we want

        those to be updated on `DOASIT` (for origin SIT) and `DDASIT` (for
        destination SIT). If updating those values in other service

        items, the office users will not have as much attention to those values.


        To create a service item, please use

    post:
      summary: createPaymentRequest
      description: >
        Creates a new instance of a paymentRequest and is assigned the status
        `PENDING`.

        A move task order can have multiple payment requests, and

        a final payment request can be marked using boolean `isFinal`.


        If a `PENDING` payment request is recalculated,

        a new payment request is created and the original request is

        marked with the status `DEPRECATED`.


        **NOTE**: In order to create a payment request for most service items,
        the shipment *must*

        be updated with the `PrimeActualWeight` value via
        [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment).


        **FSC - Fuel Surcharge** service items require `ActualPickupDate` to be
        updated on the shipment.


        A service item can be on several payment requests in the case of partial
        payment requests and payments.


        In the request, if no params are necessary, then just the `serviceItem`
        `id` is required. For example:

        ```json

        {
          "isFinal": false,
          "moveTaskOrderID": "uuid",
          "serviceItems": [
            {
              "id": "uuid",
            },
            {
              "id": "uuid",
              "params": [
                {
                  "key": "Service Item Parameter Name",
                  "value": "Service Item Parameter Value"
                }
              ]
            }
          ],
          "pointOfContact": "string"
        }

        ```


        SIT Service Items & Accepted Payment Request Parameters:

        ---

        If `WeightBilled` is not provided then the full shipment weight
        (`PrimeActualWeight`) will be considered in the calculation.


        **NOTE**: Diversions have a unique calcuation for payment requests
        without a `WeightBilled` parameter.


        If you created a payment request for a diversion and `WeightBilled` is
        not provided, then the following will be used in the calculation:

        - The lowest shipment weight (`PrimeActualWeight`) found in the diverted
        shipment chain.

        - The lowest reweigh weight found in the diverted shipment chain.


        The diverted shipment chain is created by referencing the `diversion`
        boolean, `divertedFromShipmentId` UUID, and matching destination to
        pickup addresses.

        If the chain cannot be established it will fall back to the
        `PrimeActualWeight` of the current shipment. This is utilized because
        diverted shipments are all one single shipment, but going to different
        locations.

        The lowest weight found is the true shipment weight, and thus we search
        the chain of shipments for the lowest weight found.

        ### Functionality

        This endpoint **uploads** a Proof of Service document for a
        PaymentRequest.


        The PaymentRequest should already exist.


        Optional key of **isWeightTicket** indicates if the document is a weight
        ticket or not.

        This will be used for partial and full deliveries and makes it easier
        for the Transportation Invoicing Officers to locate and review service
        item documents.

        If left empty, it will assume it is NOT a weight ticket.


        The formdata in the body of the POST request that is sent should look
        like this if it IS a weight ticket being attached to an existing payment
        request:
          ```json
          {
            "file": "filePath",
            "isWeightTicket": true
          }
          ```
          If the proof of service doc is NOT a weight ticket, it will look like this - or you can leave it empty:
          ```json
          {
            "file": "filePath",
            "isWeightTicket": false
          }
          ```
          ```json
          {
            "file": "filePath",
          }
          ```

        The update can be requested for APPROVED SIT service items only.

        Only ONE request is allowed per approved SIT service item.


        **DEPRECATION ON AUGUST 5TH, 2024**

        Following deprecation, when updating a service item's final delivery
        address, you will need to update the shipment's destination address.
        This will update the destination SIT service items' final delivery
        address upon approval.

        For `APPROVED` shipments, you can use
        [updateShipmentDestinationAddress](#mtoShipment/updateShipmentDestinationAddress)

        For shipments in any other status, you can use
        [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#mtoShipment/updateMTOShipmentAddress)
