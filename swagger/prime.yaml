    The Prime API is a RESTful API that enables the Prime contractor to request

    information about upcoming moves, update the details and status of those
    moves,

    and make payment requests. It uses Mutual TLS for authentication procedures.


    All endpoints are located at `/prime/v1/`.
basePath: /prime/v1
schemes:
  - http
tags:
  - name: moveTaskOrder
    description: >
      The **moveTaskOrder** represents a military move that has been sent to a
      contractor. It contains all the information about shipments, including
      service items, estimated weights, actual weights, requested and scheduled
      move dates, etc.
  - name: mtoShipment
    description: >
      A shipment is some (or all) of a customer's belongings picked up in one
      location and delivered to another location.

      All of the items in a shipment are weighed and transported as a discrete
      unit. One move may include multiple shipments.

      An **mtoShipment**, in particular, is a shipment that belongs to a
      [moveTaskOrder](#tag/moveTaskOrder).


      The weights for all of the shipments in a move are combined and compared
      to the customer's weight allowance.

      If the sum of the shipments is greater, the customer is liable for paying
      excess weight cost. Both the customer and

      the contractor should keep this potential cost in mind when planning a
      move and the shipments within it.
  - name: mtoServiceItem
    description: >
      A service item is a service that the contractor can bill for. For example,
      if the movers pack and/or unpack a

      customer's belongings, those are billable services (packing and
      unpacking). All **mtoServiceItems** must be

      approved by the TOO before payment can be requested.


      There are three types of service items: accessorial, MTO-level, and
      standard.


      **WIP:** Add an external link to an article that explains the different
      types of service items in more detail.

        updated if the `updatedAt` timestamp on the move or on its orders,
        shipments, service items, or payment

        requests, is later than the provided date and time.


        **WIP**: Include what causes moves to leave this list. Currently, once
        the `availableToPrimeAt` timestamp has

        been set, that move will always appear in this list.

        **WIP**: The Prime should be notified by a push notification whenever
        the TOO approves a shipment connected to

        one of their moves. Otherwise, the Prime can fetch the related move
        using the

        [getMoveTaskOrder](#operation/getMoveTaskOrder) endpoint and see if this

        Note that there are some restrictions on nested objects:


        * Service items: You cannot add or update service items using this
        endpoint. Please use
        [createMTOServiceItem](#operation/createMTOServiceItem) and
        [updateMTOServiceItem](#operation/updateMTOServiceItem) instead.

        * Agents: You cannot add or update agents using this endpoint. Please
        use [createMTOAgent](#operation/createMTOAgent) and
        [updateMTOAgent](#operation/updateMTOAgent) instead.

        * Addresses: You can add new addresses using this endpoint (and must use
        this endpoint to do so), but you cannot update existing ones. Please use
        [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#operation/updateMTOShipmentAddress) instead.


        These restrictions are due to our [optimistic locking/concurrency
        control](https://transcom.github.io/mymove-docs/docs/dev/contributing/backend/use-optimistic-locking)
        mechanism.


        Note that some fields cannot be manually changed but will still be

        This endpoint is used to **update** the addresses on an MTO Shipment.
        The address details completely replace the original, except for the
        UUID.

        Therefore a complete address should be sent in the request.


        This endpoint **cannot create** an address.

        To create an address on an MTO shipment, the caller must use
        [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment) as the parent shipment
        has to be updated with the appropriate link to the address.


        ### Errors

        The address must be associated with the mtoShipment passed in the url.

        In other words, it should be listed as pickupAddress,
        destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress or secondaryDeliveryAddress
        on the mtoShipment provided.

        If it is not, caller will receive a **Conflict** Error.


        The mtoShipment should be associated with an MTO that is available to
        prime.

        If the caller requests an update to an address, and the shipment is not
        on an available MTO, the caller will receive a **NotFound** Error.

        ### Functionality

        This endpoint can be used to update a reweigh with a new weight or to
        provide the reason why a reweigh did not occur.

        Only one of weight or verificationReason should be sent in the request
        body.


        A reweigh is the second recorded weight for a shipment, as validated by
        certified weight tickets. Applies to one shipment.

        A reweigh can be triggered automatically, or requested by the customer
        or transportation office. Not all shipments are reweighed,

        so not all shipments will have a reweigh weight.
