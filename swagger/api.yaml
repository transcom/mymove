      summary: Adds a new Blackout period to the list of blackouts associated with his TSP
      description: This is used to create a new blackout. When posting to this URL the payload Blackout should not
       contain an ID as this will be created when it is added to the DB. Similarly, the tsp_id field should be
       omitted as this will be derived from the path. Supplying either of these fields in the payload will result in a
       400 bad request.

       At least one of GBLOC, zip3, Channel/COS or Market must be supplied. If more than one of these fields are supplied
       they will be AND'd together, i.e. GBLOC, Channel will restrict to shipments in the particular Channel which
       originate in the given GBLOC.
