    The Prime V2 API is a RESTful API that enables the Prime contractor to
    request

    information about upcoming moves, update the details and status of those
    moves,

    and make payment requests. It uses Mutual TLS for authentication procedures.


    All endpoints are located at `/prime/v2/`.

      The **moveTaskOrder** represents a military move that has been sent to a
      contractor. It contains all the information about shipments, including
      service items, estimated weights, actual weights, requested and scheduled
      move dates, etc.
  - name: mtoShipment
    description: >
      A shipment is some (or all) of a customer's belongings picked up in one
      location and delivered to another location.

      All of the items in a shipment are weighed and transported as a discrete
      unit. One move may include multiple shipments.

      An **mtoShipment**, in particular, is a shipment that belongs to a
      [moveTaskOrder](#tag/moveTaskOrder).


      The weights for all of the shipments in a move are combined and compared
      to the customer's weight allowance.

      If the sum of the shipments is greater, the customer is liable for paying
      excess weight cost. Both the customer and

      the contractor should keep this potential cost in mind when planning a
      move and the shipments within it.

        ### Functionality

        This endpoint gets an individual MoveTaskOrder by ID.


        It will provide information about the Customer and any associated
        MTOShipments, MTOServiceItems and PaymentRequests.


        **NOTE**: New version in v3. Version will return PPM
        addresses[pickupAddress, destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress

        secondaryDestinationAddress]. PPM postalCodes will be phased
        out[pickupPostalCode, secondaryPickupPostalCode,

        destinationPostalCode and secondaryDestinationPostalCode].

      description: >
        Creates a new shipment within the specified move. This endpoint should
        be used whenever the movers identify a

        need for an additional shipment. The new shipment will be submitted to
        the TOO for review, and the TOO must

        approve it before the contractor can proceed with billing.


        **NOTE**: When creating a child shipment diversion, you can no longer
        specify the `primeActualWeight`.

        If you create a new diverted shipment with the `diversion` and
        `divertedFromShipmentId` parameter, it will automatically

        inherit the primeActualWeight of its `divertedFromShipmentId` parent.
        Payment requests created on a diverted shipment "chain" will utilize

        the lowest weight possible in the chain to prevent overcharging as they
        are still separate shipments.


        **NOTE**: New version in v3. Version will accept PPM
        addresses[pickupAddress, destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress

        secondaryDestinationAddress]. PPM postalCodes will be phased
        out[pickupPostalCode, secondaryPickupPostalCode,

        destinationPostalCode and secondaryDestinationPostalCode].


        **WIP**: The Prime should be notified by a push notification whenever
        the TOO approves a shipment connected to

        one of their moves. Otherwise, the Prime can fetch the related move
        using the

        [getMoveTaskOrder](#operation/getMoveTaskOrder) endpoint and see if this
        shipment has the status `"APPROVED"`.

        Note that there are some restrictions on nested objects:


        * Service items: You cannot add or update service items using this
        endpoint. Please use

        * Agents: You cannot add or update agents using this endpoint. Please
        use [createMTOAgent](#operation/createMTOAgent) and
        [updateMTOAgent](#operation/updateMTOAgent) instead.

        * Addresses: You can add new addresses using this endpoint (and must use
        this endpoint to do so), but you cannot update existing ones. Please use
        [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#operation/updateMTOShipmentAddress) instead.


        These restrictions are due to our [optimistic locking/concurrency
