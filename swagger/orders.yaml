        Creates a Revision of a set of orders.

        ## New Orders
        The supplied Revision is considered part of a new set of Orders if the combination of `ordersNum`, EDIPI, and `issuingAuthority` has never been seen before. A new UUID is created and associated with the Orders, which is returned along with the supplied Revision.

        ## Amended Orders
        If the system determines that the supplied Revision is an amendment to an existing set of Orders, then the supplied Revision is added to the existing Orders.

        If you stored the UUID of the Orders from a previous call to this API, you have the option of using the `POST /orders/{uuid}` API instead.

        ## Canceled, Rescinded, or Revoked Orders
        To cancel, rescind, or revoke Orders, POST a new Revision with the status set to "canceled".

        # Errors
        It is an error to specify an already-created seqNum in the provided Revision for an existing set of Orders.

          Orders number. Supposed to be unique, but in practice uniqueness is not guaranteed for all branches of service.

          # Army
          Typically found in the upper-left hand corner of printed orders.

          # Navy
          Corresponds to the CT (Commercial Travel) SDN. On printed orders, this is found on the SDN line in the `------- ACCOUNTING DATA -------` section in the `PCS ACCOUNTING DATA` paragraph.

          The BUPERS Orders number is not suitable, because it includes the sailor's full SSN, and the included four digit date code could repeat for a sailor if he or she gets orders exactly 10 years apart.

          No-cost moves do not have a CT SDN, because they involve no travel. Without a CT SDN, USN Orders have nothing to use for the Orders number. Such Orders won't authorize any PCS expenses either, so they do not need to be submitted to this API.

          # Marine Corps
          Corresponds to the CT (Commercial Travel) SDN. On Web Orders, the CT SDN is found in the table at the bottom, in the last column of the row that begins with "Travel".

          No-cost moves do not have a CT SDN, because they involve no travel. Without a CT SDN, USMC Orders have nothing to use for the Orders number. Such Orders won't authorize any PCS expenses either, so they do not need to be submitted to this API.

          # Air Force
          Corresponds to the SPECIAL ORDER NO, found in box 27 on AF Form 899.

          # Coast Guard
          Corresponds to the Travel Order No.

          # Civilian
          Corresponds to the Travel Authorization Number.

          No Cost Move. If true, then these orders do not authorize any move expenses. If omitted or false, then these orders are a PCS and should authorize move expenses.
          One scenario that leads to a no-cost move is a Permanent Change of Assignment without Permanent Change of Station. A PCA without PCS happens when a member is assigned to a new unit at the same duty station, or to a new duty station geographically close to the current duty station.
          It is not unheard of for the initial revision of orders to have this set to false and then later to be amended to true and vice-versa.

  Accounting:
    type: object
    properties:
      tac:
        type: string
        description: |
          Transportation Account Code - a reference to a line of accounting in the Transportation Global Edit Tables (TGET). This is the preferred way to charge a move expense to the correct pool of money.

          > TGET is a centralized repository that contains established transportation LOAs formatted in accordance with Service/Agency LOA requirements and associated TACs.

          ## Army
          Army orders do not include a TAC. Instead, they provide an MDC.

          > A movement designator code (MDC) provides the office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel with a record of the type of PCS travel performed by Active Army personnel. This record is used to centrally manage PCS funds.

          The correct TAC can be located by looking up the MDC, move type, and Fiscal Year (corresponding to the orders issuance date) in the CROSSWALK Excel spreadsheet.

          ## Navy
          Navy orders include TACs for PCS expenses (if moving expenses are authorized) and (sometimes) for NTS expenses. If present, the NTS TAC will have an underscore in the last column, which would ordinarily be populated with the last digit of the current FY. The Navy always wants to use the current Fiscal Year's TAC to pay NTS invoices, which can appear years after the Orders are cut. In other words, when it comes time to pay an NTS invoice, the underscore in the NTS TAC is replaced with the last digit of the current FY, and then that reconstructed TAC is used to look up the correct LOA in TGET.
      sdn:
        type: string
        description: |
          Standard Document Number. The SDN is one way to connect money that was obligated for a specific member's move at order issuance time to expenses incurred by that member's move at invoicing time. This obviously only works if the SDN is unique to the member and to the specific set of orders.

          ## Marine Corps
          The last four characters of the SDN should be same as the TAC.

          At the time of this writing, the Marines have separate SDNs for each category of moving expenses (HHG, POV Storage, NTS, etc.), but only one of them is unique to a specific Marine - the Commercial Travel (CT) SDN. The CT SDN **is** the Orders # for the Marines. In the future, the Marines would like to include the first 15 characters of the CT SDN in any transactions with the Third Party Payment System, and for the TPPS to include this unique value with every expense in the resulting report.
