    The Prime API is a RESTful API that enables the Prime contractor to request

    information about upcoming moves, update the details and status of those
    moves,

    and make payment requests. It uses Mutual TLS for authentication procedures.


    All endpoints are located at `/prime/v1/`.

  - name: moveTaskOrder
    description: >
      The **moveTaskOrder** represents a military move that has been sent to a
      contractor. It contains all the information about shipments, including
      service items, estimated weights, actual weights, requested and scheduled
      move dates, etc.
  - name: mtoShipment
    description: >
      A shipment is some (or all) of a customer's belongings picked up in one
      location and delivered to another location.

      All of the items in a shipment are weighed and transported as a discrete
      unit. One move may include multiple shipments.

      An **mtoShipment**, in particular, is a shipment that belongs to a
      [moveTaskOrder](#tag/moveTaskOrder).


      The weights for all of the shipments in a move are combined and compared
      to the customer's weight allowance.

      If the sum of the shipments is greater, the customer is liable for paying
      excess weight cost. Both the customer and

      the contractor should keep this potential cost in mind when planning a
      move and the shipments within it.
  - name: mtoServiceItem
    description: >
      A service item is a service that the contractor can bill for. For example,
      if the movers pack and/or unpack a

      customer's belongings, those are billable services (packing and
      unpacking). All **mtoServiceItems** must be

      approved by the TOO before payment can be requested.


      There are three types of service items: accessorial, MTO-level, and
      standard.


      **WIP:** Add an external link to an article that explains the different
      types of service items in more detail.
  - name: paymentRequest
    description: >
      The contractor submits a **paymentRequest** to the TIO for approval in
      order to be reimbursed for 1 or more

      **mtoServiceItems** on a **moveTaskOrder**.


      Proof of service documentation may be uploaded for each **mtoServiceItem**
      in a **paymentRequest**.

        Gets all moves that have been reviewed and approved by the TOO. The

        list down to only the moves that have been updated since the provided
        timestamp. A move will be considered

        updated if the `updatedAt` timestamp on the move or on its orders,
        shipments, service items, or payment

        requests, is later than the provided date and time.


        **WIP**: Include what causes moves to leave this list.  Currently, once
        the `availableToPrimeAt` timestamp has

        been set, that move will always appear in this list.
