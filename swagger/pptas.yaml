    The PPTAS API is a RESTful API that enables the Navy's PPTAS system to
    request

    information relating to current moves in progress.


    All endpoints are located at `/pptas/v1`.

      summary: listMoves
      description: >
        Gets all moves that have been reviewed and approved by the TOO. The
        `since` parameter can be used to filter this

        list down to only the moves that have been updated since the provided
        timestamp. A move will be considered

        updated if the `updatedAt` timestamp on the move or on its orders,
        shipments, service items, or payment

        requests, is later than the provided date and time.


        **WIP**: Include what causes moves to leave this list. Currently, once
        the `availableToPrimeAt` timestamp has

        been set, that move will always appear in this list.
