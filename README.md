# Personal Property Prototype

[![Build status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/transcom/ppp/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/transcom/ppp/tree/master)

This repository contains the application source code for the Personal Property Prototype, a possible next generation version of the Defense Personal Property System (DPS). DPS is an online system managed by the U.S. [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) (DoD) [Transportation Command](http://www.ustranscom.mil/) (USTRANSCOM) and is used by service members and their families to manage household goods moves.

This prototype was built by a [Defense Digital Service](https://www.dds.mil/) team in support of USTRANSCOM's mission.

## Development

### Prerequisites

Run `bin/prereqs` and install everything it tells you to. Then run `make deps`.

### Setup: Database

You will need to setup a local database before you can begin working on the local server / client. Docker will need to be running for any of this to work.

1. `make db_dev_init`: initializes a Docker container with a Postgres database.
1. `make db_dev_migrate`: runs all existing database migrations, which do things like creating table structures, etc.
1. You can validate that your dev database is running by running `bin/psql-dev`. This puts you in a postgres shell. Type `\dt` to show all tables, and `\q` to quit.

### Setup: Server

`make server_run`: installs dependencies and builds both the client and the server, then runs the server.

For faster development, use `make server_run_dev`. This builds and runs the server but skips updating dependences and re-building the client. Those tasks can be accomplished as needed with `make server_deps` and `make client_build`

You can verify the server is working as follows:

`> curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/issues --data "{ \"body\": \"This is a test issue\"}"`

from which the response should be like

`{"id":"116a53150-f0e3-11e7-8c3f-9a214cf093ae", "body": "This is a test issue", "created_at": "2017-12-02 12:33:22.121", "updated": "2017-12-02 12:33:22.121"}`

Dependencies are managed by glide. To add a new dependency:
`GOPATH=/path/to/dp3 glide get new/dependency`

### Setup: Client

`make server_run`
`make client_run_dev`

The above will start the server running and starts the webpack dev server, proxied to our running go server.

Dependencies are managed by yarn

### API

The api is defined in a single file: ./swagger.yaml and served at /api/v1/swagger.yaml. it is the single source of truth for what the API contract between client and server should be.

### Database

#### Dev Commands

There are a few handy targets in the Makefile to help you interact with the dev database:

* `make db_dev_init`: Initializes a new postgres Docker container with a test database and runs it. You must do this before any other database operations.
* `make db_dev_run`: Starts the previously initialized Docker container if it has been stopped.
* `make db_dev_reset`: Destroys your database container. Useful if you want to start from scratch.
* `make db_dev_migrate`: Applies database migrations against your running database container.

#### Migrations

If you need to change the database schema, you'll need to write a migration.

Creating a migration:

Use soda (a part of [pop](https://github.com/markbates/pop/)) to generate migrations. In order to make using soda easy, a wrapper is in `/bin/soda` that sets the go environment and working directory correctly.

If you are generating a new model, use `/bin/soda generate model model-name column-name:type column-name:type ...`. id, created_at and updated_at are all created automatically.

If you are modifying an existing model, use `./bin/soda generate migration migration-name` and add the [Fizz instructions](https://github.com/markbates/pop/blob/master/fizz/README.md) yourself to the created files.

Running migrations:

1. Use `make db_dev_migrate` to run migrations against your local dev environment. Production migrations TBD.

### Troubleshooting

* Random problems may arise if you have old Docker containers running. Run `docker ps` and if you see containers unrelated to our app, consider stopping them.
* If you have problems connecting to postgres, or running related scripts, make sure you aren't already running a postgres daemon. You can check this by typing `ps aux | grep postgres` and looking for existing processes.
