# Personal Property Prototype

This repository contains the application source code for the Personal Property Prototype, a possible next generation version of the Defense Personal Property System (DPS). DPS is an online system managed by the U.S. [Department of Defense](https://www.defense.gov/) (DoD) [Transportation Command](http://www.ustranscom.mil/) (USTRANSCOM) and is used by service members and their families to manage household goods moves.

This prototype was built by a [Defense Digital Service](https://www.dds.mil/) team in support of USTRANSCOM's mission.
