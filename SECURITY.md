# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is core to our values, and we value the input of hackers acting in good faith to help us maintain a high standard for the security and privacy for our users. This includes encouraging responsible vulnerability research and disclosure. This code repository and the entirety of the *.move.mil ecosystem falls under the Department of Defense Vulnerability Disclosure Policy, the full text of which you can find here along with a link to the consolidated Dept of Defense portal to disclose vulnerabilities found: [HackerOne for DoD](https://hackerone.com/deptofdefense)

In general, this policy sets out our definition of good faith in the context of finding and reporting vulnerabilities, as well as what you can expect from us in return.
