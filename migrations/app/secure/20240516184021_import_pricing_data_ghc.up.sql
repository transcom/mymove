-- Local test migration.
-- This will be run on development environments.
-- It should mirror what you intend to apply on loadtest/demo/exp/stg/prd
-- DO NOT include any sensitive data.

-- We had to split this migration into multiple parts because it was too large for the virus scanner.
-- Locally, we only create a few records, so we don't need anything in parts 2 and 3 of this migration.
