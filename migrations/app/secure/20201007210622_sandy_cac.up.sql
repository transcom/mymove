-- This migration allows a CAC cert to have read/write access to all orders and the prime API.
-- The Orders API and the Prime API use client certificate authentication. Only certificates
-- signed by a trusted CA (such as DISA) are allowed which includes CACs.
-- Using a person's CAC as the certificate is a convenient way to permit a
-- single trusted individual to interact with the Orders API and the Prime API. Eventually
-- this CAC certificate should be removed.
