-- POP RAW MIGRATION --

-- "Removing" diacritics is a surprisingly awkward problem
-- Diacritics are not just decorative, they are an important part of a person's name.
-- However, when searching for names, we should not expect office users to be able to
-- type diacritics/get the right ones, so we want to omit them for search, so that
-- we don't make it harder to search for names that have diacritics.
-- Postgres has an unaccent function that does exactly what we want,
-- BUT it is stable, not immutable, so we cannot use it in an index.
-- Many people suggest wrapping it in a function that is declared immutable
--   eg: https://stackoverflow.com/a/11007216
