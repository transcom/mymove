# It's best practice to treat generated files as if they were binary files
# so that they don't show up when you perform a git diff on changed files.

# Generated Golang files by `make server_generate`
pkg/gen/**/* binary

# Generated Swagger files by `yarn build-redoc`
swagger/*.yaml binary

# the dev_data_seed.sql is a dump from the migrations
# because we use randomly generated uuids, it changes every time migrations
#are re-run and is thus effectively a binary file
migrations/app/dev_data_seed.sql binary
