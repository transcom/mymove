  # Setting this to 1.17 for now instead of letting golangci-lint auto-detect 1.18 since golangci-lint turns off
  # several linters we use due to 1.18 compatibility issues. Once those are sorted out in later versions of
  # golangci-lint and the corresponding linters, we should be able to remove this line. We may also experience linter
  # issues if we start using generics before then. Follow https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/issues/2649 for
  # more info. To see which of our linters are turned off, remove this line and run `pre-commit run -a --verbose
  # golangci-lint`.
