      description: |
        Gets all moves that have been reviewed and approved by the TOO. The `since` parameter can be used to filter this
        list down to only the moves that have been updated since the provided timestamp. A move will be considered
        updated if the `updatedAt` timestamp on the move or on its orders, shipments, service items, or payment
        requests, is later than the provided date and time.

        **WIP**: Include what causes moves to leave this list. Currently, once the `availableToPrimeAt` timestamp has
        been set, that move will always appear in this list.
