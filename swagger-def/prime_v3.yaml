      description: |
        Creates a new shipment within the specified move. This endpoint should be used whenever the movers identify a
        need for an additional shipment. The new shipment will be submitted to the TOO for review, and the TOO must
        approve it before the contractor can proceed with billing.

        **NOTE**: When creating a child shipment diversion, you can no longer specify the `primeActualWeight`.
        If you create a new diverted shipment with the `diversion` and `divertedFromShipmentId` parameter, it will automatically
        inherit the primeActualWeight of its `divertedFromShipmentId` parent. Payment requests created on a diverted shipment "chain" will utilize
        the lowest weight possible in the chain to prevent overcharging as they are still separate shipments.

        **WIP**: The Prime should be notified by a push notification whenever the TOO approves a shipment connected to
        one of their moves. Otherwise, the Prime can fetch the related move using the
        [getMoveTaskOrder](#operation/getMoveTaskOrder) endpoint and see if this shipment has the status `"APPROVED"`.

        Updates an existing shipment for a move.

        Note that there are some restrictions on nested objects:

        * Service items: You cannot add or update service items using this endpoint. Please use [createMTOServiceItem](#operation/createMTOServiceItem) and [updateMTOServiceItem](#operation/updateMTOServiceItem) instead.
        * Agents: You cannot add or update agents using this endpoint. Please use [createMTOAgent](#operation/createMTOAgent) and [updateMTOAgent](#operation/updateMTOAgent) instead.
        * Addresses: You can add new addresses using this endpoint (and must use this endpoint to do so), but you cannot update existing ones. Please use [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#operation/updateMTOShipmentAddress) instead.

        These restrictions are due to our [optimistic locking/concurrency control](https://transcom.github.io/mymove-docs/docs/dev/contributing/backend/use-optimistic-locking) mechanism.

        Note that some fields cannot be manually changed but will still be updated automatically, such as `primeEstimatedWeightRecordedDate` and `requiredDeliveryDate`.
