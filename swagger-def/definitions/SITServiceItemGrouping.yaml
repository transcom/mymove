    description: >
      Holds the top level summary of a Service Item Grouping, detailing the ServiceItemID of the first day SIT
      service item (Eg, DOFSIT, DOASIT), the location (ORIGIN/DESTINATION), how many days the provided instance
      of SIT has been in storage, SIT entry date, departure date, authorized end date, customer contacted date,
      requested delivery date.

      This is provided at a top level because due to our service item architecture, SIT information is sometimes
      split across multiple service items, and this summary is a compilation of said information. This prevents
      the need to loop over many service items.
