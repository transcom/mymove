        Creates a Revision of a set of orders.

        # Identifying the service member

        The Orders Gateway associates Orders and their Revisions with the
        member's EDIPI. For users of this API who do not have the member's EDIPI
        but do have the member's SSN, they can submit the SSN instead. The
        Orders Gateway will then fetch the member's EDIPI using DMDC's Identity
        Web Services. Calls using the 9-digit SSN instead of the 10-digit EDIPI
        will take longer to respond due to the additional overhead.

        # Submitting Orders Revisions

        ## New Orders

        The supplied Revision is considered part of a new set of Orders if the
        combination of `ordersNum` and `issuer` has never been seen before. A
        new UUID is created and associated with the Orders, which is returned
        along with the supplied Revision.

        ## Amended Orders

        If the system already has Orders with the supplied combination of
        `ordersNum` and `issuer`, then the supplied Revision is considered to be
        an amendment of those Orders. The Revision with the highest `seqNum` is
        considered the most recent amendment, which is not necessarily the
        Revision with the latest `dateIssued` or the Revision submitted last.

        If you stored the UUID of the Orders from a previous call to this API,
        you have the option of using the `POST /orders/{uuid}` API instead to
        supply a new Revision.

        ## Canceled, Rescinded, or Revoked Orders

        To cancel, rescind, or revoke Orders, POST a new Revision with the
        status set to "canceled".

        # Errors

        Users of this endpoint must have permission to write Orders for the
        specified `issuer`. Otherwise, this endpoint will return `403
        Forbidden`.

        If SSN instead of EDIPI is provided to identify the member, and DMDC's
        Identity Web Services does not return an EDIPI for that SSN, then this
        endpoint will return `404 Not Found`.

        If amending existing Orders, the supplied seqNum must be unique when
        compared to existing Revisions in those Orders. If it has already been
        used, this endpoint will return `409 Conflict`.

        If amending existing Orders, the supplied memberId, as an EDIPI, or as
        an EDIPI retrieved from DMDC by SSN, must match the EDIPI in the
        existing Orders. If the EDIPIs do not match, this endpoint will return
        `409 Conflict`.

          # Army

          Typically found in the upper-left hand corner of printed orders. For
          example, "030-00362". At this time, there is no common format for
          Orders numbers between Army installations.

          # Navy

          Corresponds to the CT (Commercial Travel) SDN. On printed orders, this
          is found on the SDN line in the `------- ACCOUNTING DATA -------`
          section in the `PCS ACCOUNTING DATA` paragraph. For example,
          "N0001234ABC5XYZ".

          The BUPERS Orders number is not suitable, because it includes the
          sailor's full SSN, and the included four digit date code could repeat
          for a sailor if he or she gets orders exactly 10 years apart.

          No-cost moves do not have a CT SDN, because they involve no travel.
          Without a CT SDN, USN Orders have nothing to use for the Orders
          number. Such Orders won't authorize any PCS expenses either, so they
          do not need to be submitted to this API.

          # Marine Corps

          Corresponds to the CT (Commercial Travel) SDN. On Web Orders, the CT
          SDN is found in the table at the bottom, in the last column of the row
          that begins with "Travel". For example, "M7000213CTB28DZ".

          No-cost moves do not have a CT SDN, because they involve no travel.
          Without a CT SDN, USMC Orders have nothing to use for the Orders
          number. Such Orders won't authorize any PCS expenses either, so they
          do not need to be submitted to this API.

          # Air Force

          Corresponds to the SPECIAL ORDER NO, found in box 27 on AF Form 899.
          For example, "AJ-063322".

          # Coast Guard

          Corresponds to the Travel Order No. For example, "1214G85PRAAGK000".

          # Civilian

          Corresponds to the Travel Authorization Number. For example,
          "PS8D000025".

          the Orders, even if its dateIssued is earlier.


          The sequence number is NOT required to increase monotonically or
          sequentially; in other words, if a set of orders is modified twice,
          the sequence numbers could be 1, 5858300, and 30.

          One scenario that leads to a no-cost move is a Permanent Change of
          Assignment without Permanent Change of Station. A PCA without PCS
          happens when a member is assigned to a new unit at the same duty
          station, or to a new duty station geographically close to the current
          duty station.

          It is not unheard of for the initial revision of orders to have this
          set to false and then later to be amended to true and vice-versa.

      The common types fit into the acronym ASTRO-U.
        * **A**ccession - Joining the military

        * **T**raining
        * **R**otational
        * **O**perational
        * **U**nit Move - When an entire unit is reassigned to another installation, often as a deployment

      As of this writing, none of the branches of service distinguish between
      separation and retirement Orders in their systems, even though the NTS
      entitlement lasts longer for retirement.

      Consequences of this field include
        * NTS entitlements are different between Orders types.
        * Deadlines to create a shipment associated with Orders differs by Orders type.
        * Accession, separation, and retirement moves currently require the
          member to go through in-person counseling at the TMO / PPPO.

          Transportation Account Code - a reference to a line of accounting in
          the Transportation Global Edit Tables (TGET). This is the preferred
          way to charge a move expense to the correct pool of money.

          > TGET is a centralized repository that contains established
          transportation LOAs formatted in accordance with Service/Agency LOA
          requirements and associated TACs.

          ## Army

          Army orders do not include a TAC. Instead, they provide an MDC.

          > A movement designator code (MDC) provides the office of the Deputy
          Chief of Staff for Personnel with a record of the type of PCS travel
          performed by Active Army personnel. This record is used to centrally
          manage PCS funds.

          The correct TAC can be located by looking up the MDC, move type, and
          Fiscal Year (corresponding to the orders issuance date) in the
          CROSSWALK Excel spreadsheet.

          ## Navy

          Navy orders include TACs for PCS expenses (if moving expenses are
          authorized) and (sometimes) for NTS expenses. If present, the NTS TAC
          will have an underscore in the last column, which would ordinarily be
          populated with the last digit of the current FY. The Navy always wants
          to use the current Fiscal Year's TAC to pay NTS invoices, which can
          appear years after the Orders are cut. In other words, when it comes
          time to pay an NTS invoice, the underscore in the NTS TAC is replaced
          with the last digit of the current FY, and then that reconstructed TAC
          is used to look up the correct LOA in TGET.

          expenses incurred by that member's move at invoicing time. This
          obviously only works if the SDN is unique to the member and to the
          specific set of orders.

          ## Marine Corps

          The last four characters of the SDN should be same as the TAC.

          At the time of this writing, the Marines have separate SDNs for each
          category of moving expenses (HHG, POV Storage, NTS, etc.), but only
          one of them is unique to a specific Marine - the Commercial Travel
          (CT) SDN. The CT SDN **is** the Orders number for the Marines. In the
          future, the Marines would like to include the first 15 characters of
          the CT SDN in any transactions with the Third Party Payment System,
          and for the TPPS to include this unique value with every expense in
          the resulting report.
