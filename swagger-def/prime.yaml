    description: |
      A service item is a service that the contractor can bill for. For example, if the movers pack and/or unpack a
      customer's belongings, those are billable services (packing and unpacking). All **mtoServiceItems** must be
      approved by the TOO before payment can be requested.

      There are three types of service items: accessorial, MTO-level, and standard.

      **WIP:** Add an external link to an article that explains the different types of service items in more detail.
  - name: paymentRequest
    description: |
      The contractor submits a **paymentRequest** to the TIO for approval in order to be reimbursed for 1 or more
      **mtoServiceItems** on a **moveTaskOrder**. A service item can be on multiple payment requests if necessary.

      Proof of service documentation may be uploaded for each **mtoServiceItem** in a **paymentRequest** after the payment
      request is created via the endpoint [createUpload](#operation/createUpload).

      All weight entered should be in *pounds* and no other unit of measurement.

        Gets all moves that have been reviewed and approved by the TOO. The `since` parameter can be used to filter this

        updated if the `updatedAt` timestamp on the move or on its orders, shipments, service items, or payment
        requests, is later than the provided date and time.

        **WIP**: Include what causes moves to leave this list. Currently, once the `availableToPrimeAt` timestamp has
        been set, that move will always appear in this list.

    put:
      summary: updateMTOShipmentAddress
      description: |
        ### Functionality
        This endpoint is used to **update** the pickup, secondary, and delivery addresses on an MTO Shipment. mto-shipments/{mtoShipmentID}/shipment-address-updates is for updating a delivery address. The address details completely replace the original, except for the UUID.
        Therefore a complete address should be sent in the request.
        When a delivery address on a shipment is updated, the destination SIT service items address ID will also be updated so that shipment and service item final destinations match.

        This endpoint **cannot create** an address.
        To create an address on an MTO shipment, the caller must use [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment) as the parent shipment has to be updated with the appropriate link to the address.

        ### Errors
        The address must be associated with the mtoShipment passed in the url.
        In other words, it should be listed as pickupAddress, destinationAddress, secondaryPickupAddress or secondaryDeliveryAddress on the mtoShipment provided.
        If it is not, caller will receive a **Conflict** Error.

        The mtoShipment should be associated with an MTO that is available to prime.
        If the caller requests an update to an address, and the shipment is not on an available MTO, the caller will receive a **NotFound** Error.

    post:
      summary: updateShipmentDestinationAddress
      description: |
        ### Functionality
        This endpoint is used so the Prime can request an **update** for the delivery address on an MTO Shipment,
        after the delivery address has already been approved.

        This endpoint and operation only supports the following shipment types:
        - HHG
        - NTSR

        For HHG shipments, if automatically approved or TOO approves, this will update the final delivery address values for destination SIT service items to be the same as the changed delivery address that was approved.

        Address updates will be automatically approved unless they change:
          - The service area
          - Mileage bracket for direct delivery
          - the address and the distance between the old and new address is > 50
          - Domestic Short Haul to Domestic Line Haul or vice versa
              - Shipments that start and end in one ZIP3 use Short Haul pricing
              - Shipments that start and end in different ZIP3s use Line Haul pricing

        For those, changes will require TOO approval.

        This endpoint can be used to update a reweigh with a new weight or to provide the reason why a reweigh did not occur.
        Only one of weight or verificationReason should be sent in the request body.

        A reweigh is the second recorded weight for a shipment, as validated by certified weight tickets. Applies to one shipment.
        A reweigh can be triggered automatically, or requested by the customer or transportation office. Not all shipments are reweighed,
        so not all shipments will have a reweigh weight.

        This endpoint supports different body definitions. In the modelType field below, select the modelType corresponding
         to the service item you wish to create and the documentation will update with the new definition.

        Upon creation these items are associated with a Move Task Order and an MTO Shipment.
        The request must include UUIDs for the MTO and MTO Shipment connected to this service item. Some service item types require
        additional service items to be autogenerated when added - all created service items, autogenerated included,
        will be returned in the response.

        To update a service item, please use [updateMTOServiceItem](#operation/updateMTOServiceItem) endpoint.

        * Addresses: To update a destination service item's SIT destination final address, update the shipment delivery address.
        For approved shipments, please use [updateShipmentDestinationAddress](#mtoShipment/updateShipmentDestinationAddress).
        For shipments not yet approved, please use [updateMTOShipmentAddress](#mtoShipment/updateMTOShipmentAddress).

        * SIT Service Items: Take note that when updating `sitCustomerContacted`, `sitDepartureDate`, or `sitRequestedDelivery`, we want
        those to be updated on `DOASIT` (for origin SIT) and `DDASIT` (for destination SIT). If updating those values in other service
        items, the office users will not have as much attention to those values.

        To create a service item, please use [createMTOServiceItem](#mtoServiceItem/createMTOServiceItem)) endpoint.

        * Resubmitting rejected SIT service items: This endpoint will handle the logic of changing the status of rejected SIT service items from
        REJECTED to SUBMITTED. Please provide the `requestedApprovalsRequestedStatus: true` when resubmitting as this will give attention to the TOO to
        review the resubmitted SIT service item. Another note, `updateReason` must have a different value than the current `reason` value on the service item.
        If this value is not updated, then an error will be sent back.

        The following SIT service items can be resubmitted following a rejection:
        - DDASIT
        - DDDSIT
        - DDFSIT

        Creates a new instance of a paymentRequest and is assigned the status `PENDING`.
        A move task order can have multiple payment requests, and
        a final payment request can be marked using boolean `isFinal`.

        If a `PENDING` payment request is recalculated,
        a new payment request is created and the original request is
        marked with the status `DEPRECATED`.

        **NOTE**: In order to create a payment request for most service items, the shipment *must*
        be updated with the `PrimeActualWeight` value via [updateMTOShipment](#operation/updateMTOShipment).

        **FSC - Fuel Surcharge** service items require `ActualPickupDate` to be updated on the shipment.

        A service item can be on several payment requests in the case of partial payment requests and payments.

        In the request, if no params are necessary, then just the `serviceItem` `id` is required. For example:
        ```json
        {
          "isFinal": false,
          "moveTaskOrderID": "uuid",
          "serviceItems": [
            {
              "id": "uuid",
            },
            {
              "id": "uuid",
              "params": [
                {
                  "key": "Service Item Parameter Name",
                  "value": "Service Item Parameter Value"
                }
              ]
            }
          ],
          "pointOfContact": "string"
        }
        ```

        SIT Service Items & Accepted Payment Request Parameters:
        ---
        If `WeightBilled` is not provided then the full shipment weight (`PrimeActualWeight`) will be considered in the calculation.

        **NOTE**: Diversions have a unique calcuation for payment requests without a `WeightBilled` parameter.

        If you created a payment request for a diversion and `WeightBilled` is not provided, then the following will be used in the calculation:
        - The lowest shipment weight (`PrimeActualWeight`) found in the diverted shipment chain.
        - The lowest reweigh weight found in the diverted shipment chain.

        The diverted shipment chain is created by referencing the `diversion` boolean, `divertedFromShipmentId` UUID, and matching destination to pickup addresses.
        If the chain cannot be established it will fall back to the `PrimeActualWeight` of the current shipment. This is utilized because diverted shipments are all one single shipment, but going to different locations.
        The lowest weight found is the true shipment weight, and thus we search the chain of shipments for the lowest weight found.

        ### Functionality
        This endpoint **uploads** a Proof of Service document for a PaymentRequest.

        The PaymentRequest should already exist.

        Optional key of **isWeightTicket** indicates if the document is a weight ticket or not.
        This will be used for partial and full deliveries and makes it easier for the Task Invoicing Officers to locate and review service item documents.
        If left empty, it will assume it is NOT a weight ticket.

        The formdata in the body of the POST request that is sent should look like this if it IS a weight ticket being attached to an existing payment request:
          ```json
          {
            "file": "filePath",
            "isWeightTicket": true
          }
          ```
          If the proof of service doc is NOT a weight ticket, it will look like this - or you can leave it empty:
          ```json
          {
            "file": "filePath",
            "isWeightTicket": false
          }
          ```
          ```json
          {
            "file": "filePath",
          }
          ```

        PaymentRequests are created with the [createPaymentRequest](#operation/createPaymentRequest) endpoint.
