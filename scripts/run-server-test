# - APPLICATION: 'app' or 'orders' will change which tests are run and which migrations are run for them
# - CIRCLECI: Will reduce parallelism and make the test output verbose
# - COVERAGE: '1' will enable test coverage flags
# - DRY_RUN: '1' will build the tests but not run them
# - SERVER_REPORT: '1' will run go-junit-report and go coverage on output
# - LONG_TEST: '1' will remove the '-short' flag and run extended tests
# - NO_DB: Will disable the db reset and migration steps
#
# Don't run tests in /cmd (those are done in acceptance testing) or for generated code (in /pkg/gen/ or mocks)
# Disable test caching with `-count 1` - caching was masking local test failures
