// README: This is necessary due to the fact that webpack 5 dropped support for
// Node polyfills. We use the `process` object to do things in a couple of
// files. Search the project for `process.` to see where. To mitigate this
// update to webpack 5 and not update our code, we can configure webpack to
// support `process` again by using the `stream-http` package. We also override
// our react-scripts calls with a new package called `react-app-rewired` which
// wraps calls to `react-scripts` and allows for configuration updates to
// configuration files inside of Create React App.

// webpack is a dependency of React-Scripts
const webpack = require('webpack');

    // MiniCssExtractPlugin one with the ignoreOrder flag as True
    // README: This has to be done because of the fact that Create-React-App
    // already includes the mini-css-extract-plugin and configures it. This
    // means that just pushing a new configuration won't modify the original
    // one. So we need to find the original and override just the properties we
    // need. There may be better ways to do this but this works for now.
