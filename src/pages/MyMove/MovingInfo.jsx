            It’s common to move in a few shipments. Everything can go in one batch, or you can divide your belongings
            into several shipments.

            Keep important things with you
          </h2>
          <p>
            It’s a good idea to move things you’ll need right away and prized possessions yourself. Select a PPM
            (personally procured move) shipment to do that.
