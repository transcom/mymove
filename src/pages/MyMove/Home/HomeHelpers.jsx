      Important Notice: USTRANSCOM has contracted a single move manager to manage the hundreds of commercial moving
      companies that pack, ship, and deliver personal property worldwide. They will manage household goods,
      storage-in-transit warehouse services, and unaccompanied baggage shipments. This move manager will be your primary
      contact for scheduling and conducting your move. The DOD will oversee their work and your local transportation
      office will remain your primary DOD contact to ensure quality performance.

    <p>
      Note: This move manager does not manage personally procured moves or replace the existing programs for
      non-temporary storage or the movement of privately owned vehicles.
