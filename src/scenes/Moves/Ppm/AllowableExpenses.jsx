            <strong>Gas and fuel expenses</strong>
            <p>Gas and fuel expenses are not reimbursable.</p>
            <p>If you rented a vehicle to perform your move, you can claim gas expenses for tax purposes.</p>
            <p>
              You can not claim expenses for fuel for your own vehicles. You will be reimbursed for that fuel via DTS
              when you claim your mileage. The IRS does not allow you to claim an expense twice, and may audit you if
              you do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is one rare exception: If your fuel expenses exceed the amount paid for mileage and per diem fees on
              your travel pay. You may claim the portion of your fuel expenses for your own vehicles that exceeds that
              amount.

            <strong>When are receipts required?</strong>
            <p>You must have receipts for contracted expenses, storage facilities, and any expense over $75.</p>
            <p>
              You will need receipts for expenses under $75 if multiple expenses in that same category add up to more
              than $75.
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, it’s better to have receipts you don’t need than to be missing receipts that you do need. We
              recommend <strong>saving all your moving receipts.</strong>

              If you are missing a receipt, you can go online and print a new copy of your receipt (if you can).
              Otherwise, write and sign a statement that explains why the receipt is missing. Contact your{' '}
