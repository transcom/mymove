            <h4>Financial Liability:</h4>
            If this shipment(s) incurs costs above the allowance I am entitled to, I will pay the difference to the
            government, or consent to the collection from my pay as necessary to cover all excess costs associated by
            this shipment(s).
            <h4>Advance Obligation:</h4>
            <p>
              I understand that the maximum advance allowed is based on the estimated weight and scheduled departure
              date of my shipment(s). In the event, less weight is moved or my move occurs on a different scheduled
              departure date, I may have to remit the difference with the balance of my incentive disbursement and/or
              from the collection of my pay as may be necessary.

              furnish weight tickets within this timeframe may lead to the collection of my pay as necessary to cover
              the cost of the advance.
