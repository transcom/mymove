**Financial Liability**

For a HHG shipment, I am entitled to move a certain amount of HHG by weight, known as authorized HHG shipment weight \
(allowance or entitlement).  This allowance is based on my rank, my dependents, and the location of my move (within \
the continental United States, or beyond).  If I move more HHG weight than my maximum weight allowance, I will be \
subject to excess cost for exceeding my weight allowance or entitlement.

For a PPM shipment, I understand I will be paid 100% of what the government would have paid to move my belongings. My \
final payment will be calculated using documented weight and distance, up to my maximum weight allowance. I will not \
be paid for moving any extra weight beyond my weight allowance.

I understand I will pay taxes on monies received for moving this PPM shipment as income, and they will be deducted \
from my payment. I may submit receipts for approved expenses to reduce the taxable amount.

If the combined weight of all shipments in my move exceeds my weight allowance, I understand I am obligated to pay \
the cost difference to the government.  To facilitate collection by the government, I consent to collection, as \
prescribed by law, from my salary the amount of money necessary to cover excess shipment costs.

responsible for any expenses that may have been paid or incurred toward that shipment.
