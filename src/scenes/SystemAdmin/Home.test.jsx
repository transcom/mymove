   * the way that Jest tests run in the react-scripts package.
   *
   * Essentially, using a Create-React-App application won't let us change the basename value
   * on a per-test basis, which causes the warning to be emitted, usually intended for the
   * browser console but shown in test output here. We should migrate this component to the
   * new front end structure and, when we do so, rewrite how the browser history part works.
